# MERCEDES-BENZ-CAR-FEATURES-PREDICT-THE-TIME-IT-TAKES-TO-PASS-TESTING.-REGRESSION-

This project aimed to develop a regression model to predict the time a Mercedes Benz car takes to pass testing, using various car features as predictors. The project involved handling missing values and outliers, performing feature engineering, and implementing techniques such as label encoding, principal component analysis (PCA), and variance inflation factor (VIF) to improve model performance. The evaluation metrics used were R-squared score and mean squared error. The project aimed to provide insights into the key features that influence testing time and to develop an accurate model for predicting testing time, which could ultimately be used to improve efficiency in the manufacturing process.
